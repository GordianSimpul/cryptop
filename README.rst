version 0.4.1

Changes
------------

Added the ability to add/subtract values from your wallet within the interface. 

This now requires a CryptoCompare.com API key because of rate limits. See the Credits section.

No longer auto refresh. Press 'F5' to refresh.

Installation
------------

cryptop requires Python 3 to run, and has only been tested in Python 3.6 so far.

First clone this repo

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/GordianSimpul/cryptop

Then install cryptop through pip

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install -e cryptop .

cryptop can be installed manually, download the repo and run

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install

pip and setup.py can be run with a --user flag if you would prefer not to sudo. Both require setuptools which is included in most python installs and many distros by default

Make sure $HOME/.local/bin is in your environment PATH variable. 

Usage
-----

Start from a terminal.

.. code:: bash

    cryptop [-k api_key]

Follow the on screen instructions to add/remove cryptocurrencies from your portfolio or add/subtract values from your current wallet. The api_key option is only necessary if you didn't specify it in the .crypto/config.ini file

Customisation
-------------

Cryptop creates two config files in a .cryptop folder in your home directory.

.crypto/config.ini contains theme configuration (text/background colors) and
options to change the output currency (default USD), update frequency, number of decimal places to display and maximum width for float values.

.cryptop/wallet.json contains the coins and amounts you hold, you shouldn't need to edit it manually
